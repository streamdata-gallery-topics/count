description: AWS Database Migration Service helps you migrate databases to AWS easily
  and securely. The source database remains fully operational during the migration,
  minimizing downtime to applications that rely on the database. The AWS Database
  Migration Service can migrate your data to and from most widely used commercial
  and open-source databases. The service supports homogenous migrations such as Oracle
  to Oracle, as well as heterogeneous migrations between different database platforms,
  such as Oracle to Amazon Aurora or Microsoft SQL Server to MySQL. It also allows
  you to stream data to Amazon Redshift from any of the supported sources including
  Amazon Aurora, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, SAP ASE and SQL Server, enabling
  consolidation and easy analysis of data in the petabyte-scale data warehouse. AWS
  Database Migration Service can also be used for continuous data replication with
  high-availability.
